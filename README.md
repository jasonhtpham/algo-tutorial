# Build a dApp with Algorand and the JavaScript Algorand SDK

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a dApp with Algorand and the JavaScript Algorand SDK. It is a simple counter dApp that allows users to set, increment, decrement and query the value of a counter. The high level technical details are:

- The environment: [Algorand sandbox](https://github.com/algorand/sandbox) (a sandbox is a simulated network of nodes that can be used for testing and development purposes).
- Smart contract: written in <b>Python</b>.
- Frontend: written in <b>React Hooks</b> + [JS AlgoSDK](https://algorand.github.io/js-algorand-sdk/).

By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- [Setup a development environment using Algorand sandbox](setup.md)
- [Deploy a smart contract](#deploy-a-dapp)
- [Create a React frontend to interact with the smart contract](#create-a-react-frontend)
